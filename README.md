# <h2>Overview</h2>

A game where you have to make the ball stay on the platform. Made in unity using C#. The player taps the screen to change the direction of the ball. The objective is to guide the ball on the platform and prevent it from falling off while collecting as much diamonds as possible. If the ball falls off the platform, the game ends.
